OVERVIEW:

This project uses a battery-powered Arduino mkr1000 to connect to a WLAN in order
to send an email upon a door opening warning of an intruder.

KEY SUPPLIES:

Arduino mkr1000
Magnetic door switch
Siren
Simple slider switch

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS:

The user is required to create their own Temboo account and follow the instructions 
found here https://temboo.com/arduino/others/send-an-email Generating a sketch isn't
required, simply copy the generated Temboo app key, the app key name and temboo 
account into the provided SS_MAIN file just below #include <Temboo.h>.

The user must also rename the WIFI_SSID and WPA_PASSWORD definitions in SS_MAIN with
the name and password of the wifi network the user wishes to use.

The user must wire up the device as shown in the provided Fritzing file.  Once wired,
the device must be placed onto the door wished to be monitored and powered on.  

OPERATION DETAILS:

The device chirps for approximately 10 seconds once powered on.  During this time, 
opening the door does not send an email. Once the chirping has ended the security
system is enabled.  Once enabled, the system reacts to the opening of a door in the
following sequence:

	--3 seconds of no silence
	--System connects to wifi network
	--Email is sent
	--Siren is activated and remains activated for 5 minutes
	--Siren deactivates but system remains enabled and is ready to react to
	  door opening

The slider switch allows the user to select how the siren operates when activated--
either repeating on for 325ms and off for 325ms or constantly on.
